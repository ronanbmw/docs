## What can Salamoonder be used for?

If you missed the first two pages, they covered the basics of Salamoonder. On this page, we’ll show what you can do with Salamoonder even without prior development experience. You’ll find our own example projects to reference anytime, as well as public projects created by other users with Salamoonder integrated.

Before diving into the coding, let’s take a moment to see what’s truly possible with Salamoonder. If you’re already technically savvy and ready to jump in, feel free to skip ahead, but you might just get inspired! With Salamoonder you can

- **Manage and automate your social media presence.**

  If you’re a livestreamer on Kick, Twitch, or Whatnot, managing accounts by hand and growing at scale is a headache. Salamoonder makes it easy. Just request a solution from our API and you can automate everything from creating accounts to sending followers seamlessly.
- **Easily track and manage product pricing and details.**

  If your company tracks product prices on sites like Nike, Canada Goose, or Footlocker, you’ll run into Kasada blocking your requests. Salamoonder lets you get around that block so you can pull the data you need without the hassle.
- **Automate ordering and checkout processes effortlessly.**

  Want to snag a drop on Arc’teryx, Nike, and more? Normally you’d have to log in and order manually, hoping you’re faster than everyone else. With Salamoonder, you can automate it all in seconds and stay ahead!
