## What is Salamoonder?

Salamoonder makes bypassing anti-bots simple. No need to handle complex scripts or generate sensor data. You just request what you need and get it without extra steps. It’s designed so even beginner developers can outpace experienced ones in web scraping.

We support a wide range of [captchas](add.later.url.to.tasks) that you can solve with a single request to our API. If a task needs extra input, you can use our [Software Development Kit](https://salamoonder.mintlify.app/api-documentation/sdk/official) (SDK), which handles everything for you.
